# CS-350
A repository of work completed in CS-350 snhu

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The project was to create a smart thermostat that would monitor the ambient temperature and turn the heater or air conditioner on or off depending on if the temperature reading was higher or lower than a     set temperature. The problem it was attempting to solve was inconsistent room temperature.
* What did you do particularly well?
    - I believe my code was written clearly and concisely. It is clean and easy to read.
* Where could you improve?
     - I could use more timers and interrupts. The buttons respond too quickly, sometimes creating unintentional changes.
* What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    - I have found youtube and github to be particularly helpful when I get stuck on certain issues.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work
    - I noticed when I was reading the code there were several print debugging statements. This strategy will be very helpful moving forward.
* How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - By leaving plenty of comments about what different parts of the code do, the next programmer after me will be able to understand it. Also, the functions are properly created, so the next time I need a         function to increment a variable on a button press, I have one.
